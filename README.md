# Spleef
## Brief Description
Spleef, a simple minigame that players must use their shovels to eliminate players by digging the snow underneath the player and eliminating them either by water or by lava, last player to survive wins.
There is a lot more it has to offer, but I refer you to look in the files for more information.
## Plugin Information
### Server Version
The API is built off of 1.18, but should be able to go up towards 1.13 and beyond. If theres enough requests, I can upload a 1.12 and below version (more than likely up to
1.8). However, it will get limited updates and not much support from me since the native version of this plugin is 1.13 and beyond.
### Instructions
In order to access most of the commands, use /spleef help for information, but to create an arena, type /spleef create (arenaname) and follow the GUI process located in your hotbar. If you mess up something, you can cancel at anytime. Please note that the floor can only be a Snow_Block at this time, using anything else will not work.
### Permissions
Note: Only admins can create a spleef arena (spleef.admin), spleef.diamond (if a player wants a diamond shovel).
### Dependicies
No Dependices are required for this plugin, just drag and drop into the plugins folder and restart your server.
### Soft Dependicies
#### Vault
Vault can be used to give in-game currency and usually helps with most chat permission plugins. You can download the latest version of vault through here: 
https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault
#### PlaceholderAPI
PlaceholderAPI can be used to project the top welcoming points a player has or their current score on a hologram plugin 
(like HolographicDisplays, GHolos, DecentHolograms, etc..). You can find the latest version of PlaceholderAPI here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/
To use it, simply type in the following: '%spleef_(wins or losses)_top_(player or amount)_%'
It should return the score at which position specified.
